# This file shows an example of a YML configuration for a GRAVITY dual-field on-axis OB
# in which 2 different positions are explored around HD206893 with the science fiber.

# The first section correspond to the general setup, used for all subsequence OBs in this file
# Please refer to the ESO Template manual for additional information

setup:
  run_id: 60.A-9252(M)         # id of the run to upload the OB in the correct place
  date: 2023-07-14             # Required. But only useful if 'whereistheplanet' is used to predict position of the companion
  folder: P2GRAVITY_examples   # Folder in P2 where the OB will be uploaded. 
  INS.SPEC.RES: "HIGH"         # spectral resolution. LOW, MED, or HIGH
  INS.SPEC.POL: "OUT"          # Polarisation. OUT or IN
  ISS.BASELINE: ["UTs"]        # baselines (small, large, or UTs)
  ISS.VLTITYPE: ["astrometry"] # snapshot, imaging, time-series, or astrometry
  SEQ.MET.MODE: FAINT          # the mode for the metrology laser. Can be FAINT, ON, or OFF  
  concatenation: none          # if not none, a concatenation with this name will be created and all OBs put in here
  constraints:                 # additional constraints
    skyTransparency: "Variable, thin cirrus" 
    airmass: 1.6
    moonDistance: 10
    atm: 85%

# This section described the OBs, each made of a succession of template
# Multiple OBs can de defined in a file, but will share the same above setup.

  # Each OB is identified by a label which will also appear in P2
