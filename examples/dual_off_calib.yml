# This file shows an example of a YML configuration for a GRAVITY dual-field off-axis OB
# in which HD8799b is observed in off-axis, and a binary calibrator subsequently
# observed in SWAP to obtain the phase-reference. The sequence also ends with an on-axis
# OB in the central star to calibrate the amplitude

setup:

  date: 2023-07-14             # Required. But only useful if 'whereistheplanet' is used to predict position of the companion
  folder: P2GRAVITY_examples   # Folder in P2 where the OB will be uploaded.
