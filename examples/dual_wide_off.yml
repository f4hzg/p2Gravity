# This file shows an example of a YML configuration for a GRAVITY wide dual-field off-axis
# OB in which theta1 Ori C is observed as the science target, with theta1 Ori B as the
# fringe-tracking target, with a swap sequence.

setup:

  date: 2023-07-14             # Required. But only useful if 'whereistheplanet' is used to predict position of the companion
  folder: P2GRAVITY_examples   # Folder in P2 where the OB will be uploaded. 
  INS.SPEC.RES: "MED"          # spectral resolution. LOW, MED, or HIGH
  INS.SPEC.POL: "OUT"          # Polarisation. OUT or IN
  ISS.BASELINE: ["UTs"]        # baselines (small, large, or UTs)
