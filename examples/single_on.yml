# This file shows an example of a YML configuration for a GRAVITY single-field on-axis OB
# in which HD142527 is observed
##########################################################################################

# The first section correspond to the general setup, used for all subsequence OBs in this file
# Please refer to the ESO Template manual for additional information

setup:
  run_id: 60.A-9252(M)         # id of the run to upload the OB in the correct place
  date: 2023-07-14             # Required. But only useful if 'whereistheplanet' is used to predict position of the companion
  folder: P2GRAVITY_examples   # Folder in P2 where the OB will be uploaded. 
  INS.SPEC.RES: "HIGH"         # spectral resolution. LOW, MED, or HIGH
  INS.SPEC.POL: "OUT"          # Polarisation. OUT or IN
  ISS.BASELINE: ["large"]      # baselines (small, large, or UTs)
  ISS.VLTITYPE: ["snapshot"]   # snapshot, imaging, time-series
  concatenation: none          # if not none, a concatenation with this name will be created and all OBs put in here
  constraints:                 # additional constraints
    skyTransparency: "Variable, thin cirrus" 

ObservingBlocks:
  # Each OB is identified by a label which will also appear in P2

    description: HD142527 binary in single-field  # a short description of what this OB is
    mode: single_on                               # can be dual_wide_on, dual_wide_off, dual_on, dual_off, single_on, or single_off
    target: HD142527                              # this target name will be resolved in simbad to populate various fields
    ISS.VLTITYPE: ["snapshot"] # snapshot, imaging, time-series, or astrometry	         
    objects:
    # objects is a list fiber pointings and exposure settings. In single-on, there should be only one
